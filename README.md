Churn prediction traditionally employs customer profile and transaction data, leaving textual features like customer comments unexploited. This work compares machine learning models for churn prediction that use conventional data with those using reviews posted by customers about their purchases. Our experiments with the most used models for churn prediction in the literature reveal that using conventional data the models perform the best with RFM segmentation, achieving up to 93% F1-Score. It drops to less than 75% without RFM segmentation. In contrast, by using BERT embeddings of review texts, an F1-Score of 96% is achieved.
